	Developed an Image Classification Model on the CIFAR-10 Dataset consisting of 60,000 Images across 10 different classes
	Implemented TensorFlow’s Keras API to formulate the Model, and Segregated the Datasets into Train and Test Data (5:1 ratio)
	Efficiently Optimized the various parameters of the Model using the Adam Optimizer Algorithm, resulting in Accuracy of 83%
